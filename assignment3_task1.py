# b. Create a list called names and assign at least three names to it at the same time
names = ['Chico','Harpo','Groucho']

# c. Print the list
print(names)

# d. Add at least two new names to the list, using append() and insert()
names.append('Laurel')

# e. Print each name in the list (EXCEPT THE LAST ONE) one at a time by accessing the elements individually
print(names[0])
print(names[1])

# f. Now you need to print the last name. This time, use len() to get the length of the list,

# k. Choose one of the remaining names and use remove() to remove it from the list.

#    an f-string message along with the rest of the list to demonstrate that it is no longer in the list
